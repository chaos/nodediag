Other packages that want to make use of nodediag should add test to directory:
  %{_sysconfdir}/nodediag.d/
configs should go into:
  %{_sysconfdir}/sysconfig/nodediag.d/

Use one of the tests in /etc/nodediags.d as a template.

The test should define the following shell variables:
  $prog         name of the test
  $description  one-line description of the test
  $sanity       (optional) define only if test is quick

Tests normally include the following preamble:
  # Source nodediag config and function library
  . /etc/nodediag.d/functions || exit 2
  . /etc/sysconfig/nodediag
  diag_init
  diag_handle_args "$@"

Utility functions:
  diag_init
      Ensures that prog and description are set.  Exits on error.

  diag_handle_args
      Process arguments common to all tests.  Exits on error or if
      an option is provided that is handled immediately.

  diag_check_defined "VARIABLE"
      Tests if $VARIABLE is defined.  By convention, variables defined in
      /etc/sysconfig/nodediag.d/test or /etc/sysconfig/nodediag should be
      named DIAG_TESTNAME_whatever.  Exits if variable is not defined.

  diag_check_root
      Call this if the test requires root privileges.  Exits if not root.

The test script should exit one of these ways:
  exit $EXIT_OK      # test succeeded
  exit $EXIT_FAIL    # test failed
  exit $EXIT_NOTRUN  # test could not be run
